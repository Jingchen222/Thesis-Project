# Thesis-Project
This repository is dedicated to subseasonal climate forecasting, leveraging the power of Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The aim is to develop advanced machine learning models that can predict climate conditions on a subseasonal timescale (2-6 weeks ahead) and provide insights into the drivers of these forecasts.


# Methodology Timeline

| **Date Range**   | **Task Description**                                                                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **11.08 - 11.20** | EDA and PCA: Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify key patterns and use PCA for dimensionality reduction to find the most relevant factors affecting subseasonal climate change. |
| **11.20 - 12.04** | Data Training and Modeling: Train initial models using Random Forest and Gradient Boostingï¼Œ nn Split data into training and validation sets, and evaluate performance. |
| **12.04 - 12.18** | XAI and Metrics: Implement Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to interpret model outputs. Identify and select suitable evaluation metrics like MAE and RMSE for performance assessment. |
| **12.18 - 01.01** | Validation and Model Finalization: Validate models using cross-validation and robustness checks. Finalize the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and interpretability. |
| **01.01 - 01.31** | Model Implementation: Deploy the final model, monitor performance, and establish a process for updating the model with new data over time.                                               |
