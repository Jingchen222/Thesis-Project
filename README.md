# Thesis-Project
This repository is dedicated to subseasonal climate forecasting, leveraging the power of Conventional Neural Networks (CNN) and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The aim is to develop advanced machine learning models that can predict climate conditions on a subseasonal timescale (2-6 weeks ahead) and provide insights into the drivers of these forecasts.
