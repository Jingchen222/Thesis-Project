2024-11-17 20:29:21,024 - ERROR - ≥Ã–Ú÷¥–– ß∞‹: dimension valid_time on 0th function argument to apply_ufunc with dask='parallelized' consists of multiple chunks, but is also a core dimension. To fix, either rechunk into a single array chunk along this dimension, i.e., ``.chunk(dict(valid_time=-1))``, or pass ``allow_rechunk=True`` in ``dask_gufunc_kwargs`` but beware that this may significantly increase memory usage.
